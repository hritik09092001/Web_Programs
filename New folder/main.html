    <p>If there’s one dish that almost everyone knows in Indian cuisine, it’s biryani. The origin of this aromatic mixture of rice, spices and meat is usually credited to the Mughal kings who once ruled the subcontinent, but it’s now a popular dish all over the country.

        The meat (and vegetables, if used) and rice are cooked separately before being layered and cooked together with a mixture of spices. The type of meat used varies; goat, chicken, beef, lamb, fish or prawns are used according to the region, with eggs and potatoes sometimes added as well.

        <h2 id="tri">Curry</h2>
        <img src="main2.jpg"  alt="Not available" class="img">
        <p>“Curry” was a blanket term used by the British during the era of colonization for the wide variety of foreign dishes they couldn’t identify. While you might find a generic version of curry in the UK, Indian cuisine simply doesn’t have one singular dish called curry.</p>
            <h2 id="warm">Korma</h2>
            <img src="main3.jpg" alt="Not Available" class="img">
            <p>Like biryani, korma can be traced back to Mughlai cuisine, which specialized in meat-heavy, creamy dishes, though the current milder version most likely originated in the UK. The word comes from the Persian word qorma, which means “braise.”</p>
                <h2 id="oreo">Lamb Saag</h2>
                <img src="main4.jpg" alt="Not Available" class="img">
                <p>Saag is a term widely used in the northern region of Punjab for any leafy green vegetable dish, and in several regions nearby, including Bengal and Assam in the east. Lamb saag (also known as saag gosht) is usually made with pureed spinach and tender, juicy chunks of lamb with aromatic spices like cumin, cardamom, coriander seeds, ginger and garlic. It gets its signature creaminess from the addition of cream or yogurt.

                </p>
                    <h2 id="apple">Rogan Josh</h2>
                    <img src="main5.jpg" alt="Not Available" class="img">
                    <p>Made for the cold climate of Kashmir, the northernmost state in India, the name rogan josh likely comes from the Urdu words for “red meat.” This spicy braised dish usually uses lamb or mutton and gets its signature color from a large amount of lal mirch (Kashmiri red chilis). Milder than the usual Indian chilis, their paprika-like taste makes this dish a great starting point for anyone new to Indian cuisine.</p>
